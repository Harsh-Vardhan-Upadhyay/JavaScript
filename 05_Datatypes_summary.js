// Statiscally typed - we have to specify the type of the variable


// NON-Primitive Data types

const arrayofheros =["Harsh","Vardhan","Upadhyay"]

//we use {} to add objects in an array
let myObj = 
{
    name: "Harsh",
    number: 31,
    idNumber: "RA2111033010031"
}


// FUNCTIONS
const myfunction = function(){
    console.log("hello world")
}

myfunction()

//--> Data type of any non primitive is always returned as a object
